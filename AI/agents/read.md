In artificial intelligence, an agent is a computer program or system that is designed to perceive its environment, make decisions and take actions
to achieve a specific goal or set of goals. The agent operates autonomously, meaning it is not directly controlled by a human operator.

Prompt engineering is the art of getting AI to do what you want

Be specific
Use Technical Terms
Provide Context
Give Examples
Iterate

AI is much more than just an LLM
An LLM is just one tool in the toolkit of AI-enabled systems.
Other tools: text-to-speech, computer vision, image generation, sensor data processors, and much more

Agents
An agent pulls together multiple tools and can iterate on a task until the task is complete.

Goal: To build an AI agent from scratch to better understand how they work

ReAct pattern for Reason+Act
