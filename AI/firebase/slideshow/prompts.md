## Prompt 1

I need help creating an interactive slideshow with dot navigation
for a personal portfolio website. The slideshow should display images
and descriptions for different projects. Can you assist me in generating
the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code?

Here are the specific elements and functionality to incorporate:

-   Create a flexible HTML container for each project slide,
    ensuring each image proportionally resizes within its container.
-   Add three projects to the slider, including images, headings,
    and descriptions.
-   Overlay the headings and descriptions fully above the images,
    using a partially transparent background to ensure readability
    without obscuring the image.
-   Implement a dot navigation using HTML and CSS. Each dot should
    represent a project and visually indicate the active slide.
-   Allow users to switch between slides using the dot navigation.
-   Remember to add a fade transition between each slide when
    users navigate between the slides.

Please generate the image slider code files with detailed comments
explaining each part's functionality.

## Prompt 2

Please update the JavaScript code to automatically switch to the next slide every 5 seconds.

## Kickoff

With your guidance, I'd like to build a personal homepage using HTML and CSS.
Please note that I'll only request specific code snippets as we progress,
so there's no need to provide code until I explicitly ask for it.
Are you ready to start?

## HTML Structure

Help me design a basic HTML structure for a personal homepage.
It should have the following sections: a header, a section for
displaying my projects, an about section, and a section for
showcasing my skills. Also, include a footer.

Please add these sections as placeholders for now, as we will be coding
them and filling them out step by step.
