# â˜• Coffee Order Queue Challenge
# 1. Set up two variables: one for total price, one for drink count
# 2. Start a while True loop
# 3. Ask for the customer's name
# 4. If the name is "done", break the loop
# 5. Ask for their drink order
# 6. If it's "latte", add 3.50 to total and +1 to drink count
#    If it's "americano", add 3.00 to total and +1 to drink count
#    If it's "espresso", add 2.50 to total and +1 to drink count
# 7. If it's not one of those drinks, print a warning and continue
# 8. After the loop, print total number of drinks and total price
